<!-- I'm currently a PostDoc in the [Section for Scientific Computing](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/sections/scicom) in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at [The Technical University of Denmark](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/mikkel-paltorp-schmitt). My research focuses on leveraging problem structure to develop scalable algorithms. In particular, I have worked on implementing efficient interior point solvers utilizing the underlying problem structure for certain optimization problems found in civil engineering. Currently, I am working on problems dealing with structural health monitoring of offshore structures (time series classification and transfer learning). Furthermore, I have lately been interested in the intersection of block tridiagonal matrices, semiseparable matrices (the inverse of block tridiagonal matrices), state-space models, and Gaussian processes.

Previously I was a PhD student sitting in the [Acoustic Technology Group (ACT)](https://electro.dtu.dk/research/research-areas/electro-technology/acoustic-technology) as well as [The Centre for Acoustic-Mechanical Micro Systems (CAMM)](https://www.camm.elektro.dtu.dk) at The Technical University of Denmark. Here I solved problems regarding the computational challenges of modelling viscous and thermal effects in acoustics using the Boundary Element Method. To do so I applied techniques such as Hierarchical Matrices, The Fast Multipole Method, and Reduced Order Series Expansions. Parts of the project was carried out together with researchers at [The Technical University of Munich](https://www.epc.ed.tum.de/en/vib/home/).

I'm currently a Postdoc in the [Section for Scientific Computing](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/sections/scicom) at [DTU's](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/mikkel-paltorp-schmitt) Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. My research focuses on leveraging problem structure to develop scalable algorithms. Specifically, I've worked on efficient interior point solvers for structured optimization problems in civil engineering. At the moment, I'm exploring structural health monitoring of offshore structures, with a focus on time series classification and transfer learning.

Lately, I've become interested in the connections between block tridiagonal matrices, their semiseparable inverses, state-space models, and Gaussian processes.

Previously, I completed my PhD at DTU, working within [Acoustic Technology Group (ACT)](https://electro.dtu.dk/research/research-areas/electro-technology/acoustic-technology) and [The Centre for Acoustic-Mechanical Micro Systems (CAMM)](https://www.camm.elektro.dtu.dk). My research addressed computational challenges in modeling viscous and thermal effects in acoustics using the Boundary Element Method, applying techniques like Hierarchical Matrices, the Fast Multipole Method, and Reduced Order Series Expansions. Parts of this work were done in collaboration with researchers at [The Technical University of Munich](https://www.epc.ed.tum.de/en/vib/home/).
