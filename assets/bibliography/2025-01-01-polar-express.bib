abstract = {The projection of a symmetric matrix onto the positive semidefinite cone is an important problem with application in many different areas such as economy, physics and, directly, semidefinite programming. This problem has analytical solution, but it relies on the eigendecomposition of a given symmetric matrix which clearly becomes prohibitive for larger dimension and dense matrices. We present a fixed-point iterative method for computing an approximation of such projection. Each iteration requires matrix–matrix products whose costs may be much less than O(n3) for certain structured matrices. Numerical experiments showcase the attractiveness of the proposed approach for sparse symmetric banded matrices.}

  abstract = {In this paper we develop new Newton and conjugate gradient algorithms on the Grassmann and Stiefel manifolds. These manifolds represent the constraints that arise in such areas as the symmetric eigenvalue problem, nonlinear eigenvalue problems, electronic structures computations, and signal processing. In addition to the new algorithms, we show how the geometrical framework gives penetrating new insights allowing us to create, understand, and compare algorithms. The theory proposed here provides a taxonomy for numerical linear algebra algorithms that provide a top level mathematical view of previously unrelated algorithms. It is our hope that developers of new algorithms and perturbation theories will benefit from the theory, methods, and examples in this paper.},
